# Geolocation Predictor using Machine Learning

Machine learning model to predict MyFace+ (fictitious Social Media based on real data) usersâ€™ geolocations with mean squared error loss of 26 units. 

Language: Python
Technologies: Google Cloud Computing

# Data

Social media data of 57,562 users. 

# Build

1. Run create_data.py

This will create 3 dictionaries, one for the graph, training set, and test set, that will be used to extract features from the dataset and are pickled into the data folder.

2. Run create_features_v2.py

This creates the feature array for the training set and pickles that.

3. Run create_features_v3.py

This creates the feature array for the test set and pickles that.
    
4. Run modelSelection.py

This runs our learning on the test set and saves the predictions in a text file in the data folder.

After this, the predictions will be in a text file named submission_best_random_forest.txt in the data folder.

- cleaning.py was used to explore the dataset and analyze outliers.
- create_features_v1.py was the experimental feature extraction file. We played around with different features to extract in this file.
- create_features_v4 and 5.py were used to create the features for the train and test set with additional features appended to it.
